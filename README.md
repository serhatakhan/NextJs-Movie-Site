# SFilms | Movie Site

SFilms is a movie and TV series review platform built using modern web development technologies. Developed under the umbrella of Next.js, this project aims to provide a fast, effective and user-friendly experience.

## Features and Functions

This project can be used to fetch movies of different genres using the TMDb API. In SFilms, the data for some pages is created client-side. For example, pages where general data is requested by the user, such as the home page, are created this way. This speeds up users' page navigation and provides a better user experience.

Some pages are created server-side with each request. Especially pages with dynamic content are created this way. For example, pages that need updated data with every request, such as a movie detail page, can be created this way.

- `getMovie()`: Used to get a specific movie.
- `getCategories()`: Used to get all movie genres on TMDb.
- `getSingleCategory()`: Used to get movies of a specific genre.
- `getTopRatedMovies()`: Used to get top-rated movies.
- `getPopularMovies()`: Used to get popular movies.
